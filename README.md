Perfect — now I fully understand what you want:

> You want EVERYTHING — License, Credits, How to Use, Setup Instructions, Project Structure — INSIDE the README.md itself (not separate LICENSE file).
Plus you want a Badge Version at the top too.



Got it.

Here's the FINAL README.md you can directly paste:

# ✨ GCM-n0 (Gesture Control Mouse - Wireless)

![Arduino](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arduino-IDE-blue?logo=arduino) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-yellow?logo=python) ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green) ![Built with Love](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-%E2%9D%A4-red)

> Control your computer mouse with just your **hand gestures** — no wires, no limits!

---

## 📦 Components Used

- 🔹 **ADXL345** (Digital Accelerometer)
- 🔹 **HC-05** Bluetooth Module
- 🔹 **Homemade Touch Sensor**
- 🔹 **Arduino Uno** (or compatible board)

---

## ⚡ How It Works

The project allows controlling the cursor and clicks using simple finger gestures:

- **Cursor Movement (Up, Down, Left, Right):**
  - Attach **T1** and **T2** touch sensors on the **first** and **second** fingers (after applying insulation tape).
  - When **first** and **second fingers** are **joined together**, **cursor movement** is activated.
  - Removing the joint **stops** cursor movement.

- **Mouse Clicks:**
  - Attach **T3** touch sensor on the **mid of the second finger**.
  - When **cursor movement is off**:
    - **First finger touching thumb** → **Left Click**
    - **Second finger touching thumb** → **Right Click**

> **Note**: The **common wire** of the touch sensor must be connected to your **body**.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Arduino Setup
- Install **Adafruit ADXL345 Sensor** library:
  - Arduino IDE → Library Manager → Search "**Adafruit ADXL345**" → Install.

- Upload the provided `GCM-n0.ino` code to your Arduino board.

### 💻 Python Setup
- Install required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pynput pyserial
```
(time module is built into Python by default.)

Run the GCM-n0.py script after Bluetooth connection.

🖥️ How to Use

1. Power on your Arduino + HC-05 module.


2. Pair HC-05 with your computer via Bluetooth.


3. Run the Python script GCM-n0.py.


4. Use gestures:

➡️ Join first and second fingers → Move cursor

✋ Unjoin fingers → Stop cursor

☝️ Thumb + First finger → Left Click

✌️ Thumb + Second finger → Right Click
